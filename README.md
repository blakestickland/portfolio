# portfolio
A portfolio using responsive design to render on all devices, windows and screen sizes, great and small.

# SUCCESSES

-- Able to get header and footer to stay in position across all screen widths.

-- 

## Problems to address:

# common to all .hmtl pages

-- change font for headings (h1, h2, h3, etc are serif fonts not the bootstrap default serif family).

-- text begins to shrink when screen < 600px wide;

-- main container does not start spacing below navbar, it starts at top of screen so margins are not quite right. 

-- HEADER
    * at the moment, navbar collapses < 768px ;
    

-- FOOTER
 ** Could make an anchor hover plus link back to index.html page of Blake Stickland site.
