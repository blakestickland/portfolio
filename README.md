## GOALS:


## Problems to address:

# common to all .hmtl pages

-- Spent a lot of time on Navbar but could not form a useful wrap of the list items to underneath a centred heading "(Blake Stickland") when screen width is small. Will continue to work on it and try to put the entire navbar in two containers. 

-- main container does not start spacing below navbar, it starts at top of screen so margins are not quite right. tried display:block but did not work.


# index.html page

// TODO add icons for Lined In profile etc.

// TODO add hamburger image in menu bar for small screens



-- text begins to shrink when screen < 600px wide.


# portfolio.html page


// TODO replace placeholders with 4 projects.

// TODO create cards for the portfoilio links (enhancement)

-- doesn't quite work correctly in responsiveness. added bg-color to assist working out the re-sizing of the images. 

-- images and text do stack vertically when screen width is reduced though. 

# contact.html page

-- added a max-width so that it does not re-size to an unnecessary scale. 
-- sizing is responsive.
