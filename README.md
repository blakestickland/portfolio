# SUCCESSES

-- Able to get header and footer to stay in position across all screen widths.

-- Able to use Bootstrap for a lot of styling. However it was challenging working out why some desired functions did not work. When discovered it was usually related to nested elements overrding the desired property value. Also came down to initial layout. In future, I will layout everything with background colors to be able to see positioning use Inspector to work out padding and margins. 

## Problems to address:

# common to all .hmtl pages

-- Spent a lot of time on Navbar but could not form a useful wrap of the list items to underneath a centred heading "(Blake Stickland") when screen width is small. Will continue to work on it and try to put the entire navbar in two containers. 

-- main container does not start spacing below navbar, it starts at top of screen so margins are not quite right. tried display:block but did not work.


# index.html page

-- text begins to shrink when screen < 600px wide.


# portfolio.html page

-- doesn't quite work correctly in responsiveness. added bg-color to assist working out the re-sizing of the images. 

-- images and text do stack vertically when screen width is reduced though. 

# contact.html page

-- added a max-width so that it does not re-size to an unnecessary scale. 
-- sizing is responsive.
