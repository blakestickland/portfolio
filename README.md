## Problems to address:

# common to all .hmtl pages

-- Spent a lot of time on Navbar but could not form a useful wrap of the list items to underneath a centred heading "(Blake Stickland") when screen width is small. Will continue to work on it and try to put the entire navbar in two containers. 

-- main container does not start spacing below navbar, it starts at top of screen so margins are not quite right. tried display:block but did not work.
